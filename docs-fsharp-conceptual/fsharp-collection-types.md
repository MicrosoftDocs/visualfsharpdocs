# F# Collection Types

By reviewing this topic, you can determine which F# collection type best suits a particular need. These collection types differ from the collection types in the .NET Framework, such as those in the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace, in that the F# collection types are designed from a functional programming perspective rather than an object-oriented perspective. More specifically, only the array collection has mutable elements. Therefore, when you modify a collection, you create an instance of the modified collection instead of altering the original collection.

Collection types also differ in the type of data structure in which objects are stored. Data structures such as hash tables, linked lists, and arrays have different performance characteristics and a different set of available operations.


## F# Collection Types
The following table shows F# collection types.

Sequences are particularly useful when you have a large, ordered collection of data but don't necessarily expect to use all the elements. Individual sequence elements are computed only as required, so a sequence can perform better than a list if not all the elements are used. Sequences are represented by the seq&lt;'T&gt; type, which is an alias for IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;. Therefore, any .NET Framework type that implements **System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable&#96;1** can be used as a sequence.|[Sequences &#40;F&#35;&#41;](Sequences-%5BFSharp%5D.md)<br /><br />[Seq Module](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/54e8f059-ca52-4632-9ae9-49685ee9b684)|

### Table of Functions
This section compares the functions that are available on F# collection types. The computational complexity of the function is given, where N is the size of the first collection, and M is the size of the second collection, if any. A dash (-) indicates that this function isn't available on the collection. Because sequences are lazily evaluated, a function such as Seq.distinct may be O(1) because it returns immediately, although it still affects the performance of the sequence when enumerated.
