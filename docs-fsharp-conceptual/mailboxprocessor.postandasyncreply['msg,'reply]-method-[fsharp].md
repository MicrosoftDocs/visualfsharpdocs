# MailboxProcessor.PostAndAsyncReply<'Msg,'Reply> Method (F#)

Posts a message to an agent and await a reply on the channel, asynchronously.

**Namespace/Module Path:** Microsoft.FSharp.Control

**Assembly:** FSharp.Core (in FSharp.Core.dll)


## Syntax

```fsharp
// Signature:
member this.PostAndAsyncReply : (AsyncReplyChannel<'Reply> -> 'Msg) * ?int -> Async<'Reply>

// Usage:
mailboxProcessor.PostAndAsyncReply (buildMessage)
mailboxProcessor.PostAndAsyncReply (buildMessage, timeout = timeout)
```

#### Parameters
*buildMessage*
Type: [AsyncReplyChannel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e32fd8ec-37dd-4e63-94a5-67709962d1d0)**&lt;'Reply&gt; -&gt;   'Msg**


The function to incorporate the AsyncReplyChannel into the message to be sent.


*timeout*
Type: [int](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/025d5455-3622-4ea5-9573-3ecbd4ee1375)


An optional timeout parameter (in milliseconds) to wait for a reply message. The default is -1 which corresponds to **System.Threading.Timeout.Infinite**.

## Return Value

An asychronous computation ([`Async`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/03eb4d12-a01a-4565-a077-5e83f17cf6f7) object) that will wait for the reply from the agent.

## Remarks
The message is generated by applying *buildMessage* to a new reply channel to be incorporated into the message. The receiving agent must process this message and invoke the Reply method on this reply channel precisely once.

## Example

The following code example shows a mailbox processor agent that uses `PostAndAsyncReply`. The return value of `PostAndAsyncReply` is an asynchronous workflow, which in this example is started by using `Async.StartWithContinuations`, to set up the code that handles the reply.

Here is an example session. The output might be interleaved, which shows that the message processing function is running on multiple threads.
