# F# Development Environment Features

This topic includes information about which features of Visual Studio 2012 are supported in F#.


## Project Features
The following table summarizes the templates that are available for use in F# projects. For information about project and item templates, see [NIB Creating Projects from Templates](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7c36d86a-6b79-4480-8228-0f925f1204b2).



|Template type|Description|Supported templates|
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
|Project templates|Types of projects available in the **New Project** dialog box.|<ul><li>F# Application<br /></li><li>F# Library<br /></li><li>F# Tutorial<br /></li><li>F# Portable Library<br /></li><ul/>|
|Item templates|File types available in the **Add New Item** dialog box.|<ul><li>F# source file (.fs)<br /></li><li>F# script (.fsx)<br /></li><li>F# signature file (.fsi)<br /></li><li>Configuration file (.config)<br /></li><li>SQL Database Connection (LINQ-to-SQL type provider)<br /></li><li>SQL Database Connection (LINQ to Entities type provider)<br /></li><li>OData Service Connection (LINQ type provider)<br /></li><li>WSDL Service Connection (type provider)<br /></li><li>XML file (.xml)<br /></li><li>Text file<br /></li><ul/>|
To create an application that can run as a standalone executable, choose the F# Application project type. To create a library (that is, a managed assembly or .DLL file) for use on the Windows desktop platform, choose F# Library. To create a portable library that can be used on any supported platform, choose F# Portable Library. F# Portable Library projects reference a version of FSharp.Core.dll that is appropriate to create an F# library that can be used with applications that run on platforms such as Windows Store apps, the .NET Framework 4.5, Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android.

For more information about the item templates for data access, see [Type Providers](Type-Providers.md).

The following table summarizes project-properties features supported and not supported in F#. For more information, see [Configuring Projects &#40;F&#35;&#41;](Configuring-Projects-%5BFSharp%5D.md) and [Introduction to the Project Designer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/898dd854-c98d-430c-ba1b-a913ce3c73d7).
