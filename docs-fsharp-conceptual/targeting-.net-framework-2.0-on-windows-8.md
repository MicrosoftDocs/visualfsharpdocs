# Targeting .NET Framework 2.0 on Windows 8

The following error might appear if you try to target the .NET Framework 2.0, 3.0, or 3.5 in an F# project when Visual Studio is installed on Windows 8.1: 

```
This project requires the 2.0 F# runtime, but that runtime is not installed.
```

This error is known to occur under the following combination of conditions:


- You installed Visual Studio on Windows 8.1.
<br />

- You didn’t enable the .NET Framework 3.5 before you installed Visual Studio.
<br />

- Your project targets the .NET Framework 2.0, 3.0, or 3.5.
<br />

When you install Visual Studio, it detects the installed versions of the .NET Framework and installs the F# 2.0 Runtime only if the .NET Framework 3.5 is installed and enabled.


## Resolving the Error
To resolve this error, you can either target a newer version of the .NET Framework, or you can enable the .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 8.1 and then install the F# 2.0 runtime by running the setup program for Visual Studio with the **Repair** option.


#### To enable the .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 8.1

1. On the **Start** screen, start to enter **Control Panel**.
<br />  As you enter that name, the **Control Panel** icon appears under the **Apps** heading.
<br />

2. Choose the **Control Panel** icon, choose the **Programs** icon, and then choose the **Turn Windows features on or off** link.
<br />

3. Make sure that the **.NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)** check box is selected, and then choose the **OK** button.
<br />  You don’t need to select the check boxes for any child nodes for optional components of the .NET Framework.
<br />  The .NET Framework 3.5 is enabled if it wasn't already.
<br />


#### To install the F# 2.0 runtime

1. In the Control Panel, choose the **Programs** link, and then choose the **Programs and Features** link.
<br />

2. In the list of installed programs, choose the edition of Visual Studio that you installed, and then choose the **Change** button.
<br />

3. After setup starts, choose the **Repair** button.
