# MailboxProcessor.PostAndReply<'Msg,'Reply> Method (F#)

Posts a message to an agent and await a reply on the channel, synchronously.

**Namespace/Module Path:** Microsoft.FSharp.Control

**Assembly:** FSharp.Core (in FSharp.Core.dll)


## Syntax

```fsharp
// Signature:
member this.PostAndReply : (AsyncReplyChannel<'Reply> -> 'Msg) * ?int -> 'Reply

// Usage:
mailboxProcessor.PostAndReply (buildMessage)
mailboxProcessor.PostAndReply (buildMessage, timeout = timeout)
```

#### Parameters
*buildMessage*
Type: [AsyncReplyChannel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e32fd8ec-37dd-4e63-94a5-67709962d1d0)**&lt;'Reply&gt; -&gt;   'Msg**


The function to incorporate the [AsyncReplyChannel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e32fd8ec-37dd-4e63-94a5-67709962d1d0) into the message to be sent.


*timeout*
Type: [int](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/025d5455-3622-4ea5-9573-3ecbd4ee1375)


An optional timeout parameter (in milliseconds) to wait for a reply message. The default is -1 which corresponds to **System.Threading.Timeout.Infinite**.

## Return Value

The reply from the agent.
## Remarks
The message is generated by applying *buildMessage* to a new reply channel to be incorporated into the message. The receiving agent must process this message and invoke the `Reply` method on this reply channel precisely once.

## Example

The following code example shows how to start a mailbox processor agent. In this example, each line of input from the console is posted to a message queue. The program reads each message and replies by using a reply channel. When the special message "Stop" is received, the Stop reply is sent and the program exits.
